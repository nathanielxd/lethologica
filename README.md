Lethologica is an easy-to-use, beautiful dictionary app that allows users to query and save words into a vocabulary list stored on their devices.

Featuring smart auto-suggestion, offline storage and Material 3-based theming, this project's conception came from the idea of how complicated most vocabulary apps are, and I wanted something that I could quickly open up while reading a book or studying.

The app uses a free dictionary API and imposes a clean, structured architecture that allows it to be expanded anytime.
